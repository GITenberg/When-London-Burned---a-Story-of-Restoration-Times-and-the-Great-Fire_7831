description: The hero of this story was the son of a nobleman who had lost his estates
  during the troublous times of the Commonwealth. Instead of hanging idly about the
  court seeking favors, Cyril Shenstone determined to maintain himself by honest work.
  During the Great Plague and the Great Fire, which visited London with such terrible
  results, Sir Cyril was prominent among those who brought help to the panic-stricken
  inhabitants. This tale has rich variety of interest, both national and personal,
  and in the hero you have an English lad of the noblest type wise, humane, and unselfish.
